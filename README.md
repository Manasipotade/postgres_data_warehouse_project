# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project with PostgreSQL

Welcome to my Data Warehouse and Analytics Project! This portfolio project demonstrates my ability to design, build, and analyze a robust data warehouse using PostgreSQL, all while adhering to industry best practices. From data modeling to ETL processes, this project ensures scalability, efficiency, and accuracy in data management.

Here, you'll find how raw datasets are transformed into a structured format optimized for querying and reporting. Through this project, I aim to showcase my skills in SQL, data warehousing, and analytics to derive actionable insights.
